            Starting off I wasn't really sure where I wanted to go with this project. As the deadline for the presentation
            approached, I really started to draw up a plan to make my proposed game at the beginning of the semester. The first
            step for me was getting my PIXI window to match the size of the window it was in on reload of the page. Once I got that set,
            it was time to get the basic game states created. This included the start game screen, the main game, the pause menu, the
            controls menu, and the game over screen. Once those were set, I had to get all the labels and buttons in place throughout
            each game state to make the game both look good, and function properly. Following that was making the main game work and 
            function like it was intended to. After running into a decent amount of errors, I got the game working and was ready to add
            improvements to it, to make it even better. In the end, the game came out looking about what I wanted it to (with a few things 
            taken away due to time constraints) and I'm planning on adding to this and putting it on my portfolio.

            Creating the actual game was really quite enjoyable. Everything from making the PIXI Text, to moving and rotating the different 
            sprites in the game gave me a new challenge. In terms of the requirments, my additional HTML5 technology was using local storage 
            to show the previous high score when the user opens the game. I included multiple ES6 classes including one that used a little bit 
            of inheritance. My HTML is valid, and I didn't use any CSS. There are also no errors in my code (as seen in the console). Any images 
            I used were for sprite textures, and they are all appropriately sized (in my opinion). The really special things about my project (what 
            I consider above and beyond) is transitioning through game states (like pause, game over, etc) and everything resetting properly along with 
            my implemented abilities. The two abilities I implemented were gain a life and disappear. For libraries I used Howler.js (like in Circle Blast) 
            with different sounds and I used Pixi.js as my other library.
